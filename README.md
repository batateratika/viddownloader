### viddownloader

## What is this? 

If in short, personal mini-project that utilizes [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) library to download videos or audio from YouTube. 

## Why not just use yt-dlp library right away? 

Because I am an idiot. Also, I wanted to make it really simple and convinient for me to use. 

## How do you use it(supposedly, right now being under work)

# Video

You will need to use `python3 main.py -v <link to the video>`. This will download video in mp4 format. 

Yes, the quality is bad, I am figuring out how to do it right.

# Audio

Use `python3 main.py -a <link to the video>`. This will download audio on m4a format.


## Dependencies

    * yt-dlp
    * ffmpeg

List could be expanded upon me coming up with some ingenious functionality.
